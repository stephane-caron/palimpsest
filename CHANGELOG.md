## [1.0.0] - 2022/04/25

This is the initial release of _palimpsest_, a small C++ library that provides a ``Dictionary`` type meant for fast value updates and serialization. It is called palimpsest because these dictionaries are designed for frequent rewritings (values change fast) on the same support (keys change slow).
